Added a slight animation that changes a string's middle x coordinate upon pluck.
Player can change pitch by "pressing" on frets with their left hand, while plucking with their right hand.
Frets increase the pitch from top -> bottom by a semitone each.
The "press gesture" just detects if the left hand is within range of the fret.
Buttons on the left light up if a fret is "pressed".
